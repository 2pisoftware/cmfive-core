[[title|Inbox Overview]]

Flow has an internal messaging system, similar to email. You can send messages to other users in Flow, however these messages
do not go out to an email address, but stay internal to Flow (so they get delivered a lot faster!).

Your [[help|inbox/index|inbox]] is the core of this messaging system. It shows you all messages that you have received, new ones and 'read' ones.

You can [[help|inbox/send|create messages]] and send them to other users.
