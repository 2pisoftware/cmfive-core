From Carsten: 

As my workload increases I really need this feature so that I can mark the projects and individual tasks which I need to monitor. I think the interface should look like this:

to mark something as favourite
-> not useful to mark a page a favourite! Rather give the action implementor the option to easily add a button to mark an OBJECT a favourite ... the favourite table would then store the object class, the id and the user id.

to display favourites
-> make this a partial and a dashboard widget
-> the display should be full width with a tabbed interface with the different object classes at the top
-> each tab would display a lost of objects using the standard SEARCH methods for displaying
-> this means that if you want an object to be marked as favority you also have to implement the search title etc. functions
-> the favourite display is very similar to a handpicked search list
