// Instructions to disable MySQL Default Stopwords //
// To be run using root access //

-> In the mysql config file, under the [mysqld] heading add the following lines

ft_min_word_len=1
ft_stopword_file = ""

// this will disable all mysql default stopwords. To re-enable the default stopwords comment the lines out by adding a hash as seen below. 

# ft_stopword_file = ""
# ft_min_word_len=1

-> Save the file
-> Restart MySQL server
-> Then check your table engine under the operations tab after selecting the object_index table
-> If your table engine is InnoDB you will have to change it to MyISAM by querying the following

ALTER TABLE object_index ENGINE = MyISAM;

-> After your table is confirmed to be using the MyISAM engine, repair Search Table by querying the following 

REPAIR TABLE object_index QUICK;

-> There are now no default stopwords!
