- Fixed an issue where tab names containing a parenthesis would not focus the matching tab content
 - Currently, the main place where a tab name would also be used as the ID for tab content is in the Forms module
- Finished hotfix "InstallerConfigFix" - changes incorrect usage of Config::set to be Config::append in the installer config template
